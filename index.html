            This will server as a my personal blog on things I want to share. </b>
            I will try not to replicate stuff which is already covered extensivelly on the webs.</b>
            However, it is also a collection for my own benefit so something I want to keep, <b/>
            will be here too.</b>
        
            If there is any code to share it will be convinient to share it here on github.</b>  
            What you may come across are articles on Data, Cloud GCP and my DIY projects. </b>
            So some 3D printing and basic electronics/IOT.  

            Nothing more to see here, yet.</h2>
