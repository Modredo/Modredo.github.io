                This will serve as a my personal blog on things I want to share. 
                I will try not to replicate stuff that is already covered extensivelly on the webs. 
                However, it is also a collection for my own benefit so something I want to keep, 
                will be here too.           
                If there is any code to share it will be convinient to share it here on github. 
                What you may come across are articles on Data, Cloud GCP and my DIY projects. 
                So some 3D printing and basic electronics/IOT.  
                Nothing more to see here, yet.
